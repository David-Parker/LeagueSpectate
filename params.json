{"name":"League Spectate","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to League Spectate\r\nLeague Spectate is a lightweight tool/Graphical frontend written in C#.\r\nEssentially it enables anyone with a League of Legends client and an acccount in the proper region to get the spectator/observer data for any public game and spectate it right from the League of Legends client. As an extra function you can load \"*.bat\" files from op.gg/spectate/ and fow.kr (its like a korean lolking). Those crash most of the EU clients in my experience by default but you can load them without any problems with League Spectate.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n1. Download .NET 4.5 if you haven't installed it before.\r\n   http://www.microsoft.com/en-GB/download/details.aspx?id=30653\r\n\r\n2. Download League Spectate (Zip Folder on the top of this page)\r\n3.

It will download a bat file\r\n4. Load up League Spectate, open the \"Extras\" window\r\n5. Browse from op.gg bat and browse the bat file you just downloaded\r\n\r\n1. Go here http://fow.kr/\r\n2. Search for a summoner (You can take \"SKT T1 Faker\" for example)\r\n3. Choose a game and press the green \"Play\" button\r\n4. It will download a bat file\r\n5. Load up League Spectate, open the \"Extras\" window\r\n6.
