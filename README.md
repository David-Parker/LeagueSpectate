Q: This is suspicious, i'm pretty sure this program is not safe, is it?
A: It is open source, you can compile all of the libraries and the program yourself.

Q: There are tools like lolnexus and quickfind.kassad.in why would i bother trying a tool like this?
A: First of all if you have League of Legends installed to a different path than default those simply break.
   They are inconvenient and ugly in my opinion, but hey noone forces you to use this.

A: I'll try my best, feel free to open an issue at the project page.
